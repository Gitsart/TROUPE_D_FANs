# TROUPE_D_FANs
Project-FanUsing Stepper and servo functioning while SYnced to a MUSIC. _MAHESH
Test Codes using arduino UNO and Nema17 locally sourced driver
Developed codes for UNO with MObaTools Library and Inhand Advanced 3Ampere drive. 
Tested stepper Rotation 
Added a Sensor to find stepper home_ InductiveProximity-DigitalLogicSensor 10V+ Read through Voltage divider.
Added Servo to test Logic. 
Fixed Nema 23 for better functionality.
Changing controller to ESP32.
Test Codes and main code are developed in arduino IDE and freeRTOS functions.
